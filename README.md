# Expense Tracker App

<br>

_This Expense Tracking App was written using vanilla HTML/CSS as well as basic Javascript_

<br>

This app allows users to log different types of expenses, to then be tracked until they are deleted.

## Summary

This app allowed me to further put my knowledge of HTML/CSS and basic Javascript to the test. Though similar to the To-Do App, the differences proved to be a challenge enough.
